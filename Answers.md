###How long time did you end up spending on this coding test?
About 15-20 hours. Lost count, but did most of this during the weekend. 80+ % of the time was spent searching for weird errors.
Those errors were (of course) fixed by a missing parenthesis and a body parser...** insert face palm here... **
###Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.
I chose Vue with Vuex for the frontend and node.js (Express) as backend. 
The main reason for this is because I just started learning web development, and I'm completely sold on this concept. 
I love Vue, especially vuex and running a server with  node.js is so simple, that even I can understand it.
I wished I'd learned this long ago, because it has really helped me excel at development in general.
When you'll meet with me at the audition, I'll explain more.
###What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time on the coding test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.
More error handling. And null checks!
I would've broken up the analyze method in to several methods, since it's way too big. 
I'd probably add some CSS as well, images and made an about page etc. Deploy it somewhere.
Make a whole application of it, just because.
###What did you think of this recruitment test?
It was harder than I thought, but fun and I've learned even more about api calls, web development and databases. 
I really hope you'll give me a chance. The oddball in me really thinks you should ;-)
